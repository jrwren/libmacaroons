Description: Macaroons are flexible authorization credentials
  Macaroons are flexible authorization credentials that support decentralized
  delegation, attenuation, and verification.  This library provides an
  implementation of macaroons[1], which are flexible authorization tokens that
  work great in distributed systems.  Like cookies, macaroons are bearer tokens
  that enable applications to ascertain whether their holders' actions are
  authorized.  But macaroons are better than cookies!
